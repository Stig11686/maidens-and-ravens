        <p class="text-wrap text-md">The street is described as one of the most handsome in York and is home to beautiful book shops and lovely places to eat.  It has been used as a location for many period dramas due to the Georgian building and cobbles.</p>
        <p>Small but perfectly formed, we are definitely not your traditional grey and white bridal shop! Our vibe is colourful and pretty, a bit vintage, with a little darkness and lots of curious details. We do not do minimalist style here! </p>
        <p>When you book in with us you will have this beautiful space completely to yourself and our aim is to give you an experience to remember.
        Like our dresses, we love to be unique, and this is definitely reflected in our choice of everything from our wallpaper to our lighting.
        Look out for the ravens...</p>

          <p class="text-wrap text-md">Our nearest carpark is Nunnery Lane, and we are about 5 minutesâ€™ walk from the train station.
              If driving from out of York, the park and ride is advisable.
          </p>
          <h3 class="mb-0 text-2xl lg:text-3xl">Accessibility</h2>

          <p>As with much of York, our building is old, and the entrance to the shop is a little narrow. There is one very low step to get inside which is still accessible by wheelchair and with a buggy. We are situated on Micklegate which does have some limited paid parking outside for up to 2 hours on a first come first served basis. We will always do whatever we can to help so please feel free to ask if you need any specific assistance.
