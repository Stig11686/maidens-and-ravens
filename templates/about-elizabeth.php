        <p class="text-2xl">Hello my Queens!</p>
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">I am Elizabeth and I am the founder, owner and bridal mavern at Maidens and Ravens, here in the historic city of York. </p>
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">Did you know that a mavern is someone who is experienced and knowledgeable? Seemed like a fitting name for me.</p>
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">I started my journey into Bridalwear in 2019 but before that I always had a love for art, making things, sewing, knitting and vintage clothing. Growing up in Edinburgh, I enjoyed charity shop snooping and loved buying dresses from the 60s and 70s which I would get tailored to me. Like all of my friends, my prom dress was a 1980s bridesmaid dress - mint green with puff sleeves and lace! I wanted to look like Sarah from Labyrinth in the ballroom scene with David Bowie, complete with ribbons in my hair! I still love that look.</p>

        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">Believe it or not I am a practising family lawyer and since 2003 I have been helping people with their divorces, financial arrangements and children matters. All very rewarding but over the years I missed a creative outlet.</p>
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">Like many of you, I became an avid watcher of Don't tell the Bride (I loved when the groom had to choose the dress) and Say Yes to the Dress. I started imagining how wonderful it would be to own my own bridal boutique and help brides find their perfect dresses.</p>
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">I opened my original Reloved boutique in 2019 and after winning the Best Bridal Boutique in Yorkshire in 2022, 2023 ... I became fully independent in 2024 choosing to better adapt my boutique to my brides.</p>

      <div class="flex flex-col items-start gap-8 decorated-list lg:w-5/12">
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">I have a real passion for helping all of my brides. I am a people person and am genuinely committed to helping you find a dress which makes you feel beautiful and meets your dreams! I firmly believe there is a dress for every bride (and a bride for every dress!). I love brides of every age, shape, size and colour. I pride myself in being fully inclusive and making your appointments as relaxed and enjoyable as possible.</p>
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">I love quirky, interesting dresses - vintage inspired, colour and alternative styles especially dark and gothic. That said, I also adore classic looks, beautiful princess ballgowns and clean contemporary styles. I have a real eye for what suits you and will suggest different options to adapt a dress to work better for you. I will often pick out a wild card dress for you (sometimes it comes to me as soon as I meet you!) and many of my brides have actually found that it is the one.</p>
        <p class="text-wrap text-lg">Basically, whatever is your dream dress, I want to help you achieve it and if you have no idea, then that's absolutely fine too.  We will find it.</p>
