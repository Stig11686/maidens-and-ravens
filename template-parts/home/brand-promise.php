      <p class="text-xl leading-normal">More and more couples are making conscious decisions to be more environmentally friendly when planning their weddings. Bridalwear is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to fast fashion, not to mention the polluting effects of the production process so it is one area where you can make a difference.  At Maidens & Ravens I am passionate in doing what I can to offer my brides a truly sustainable choice.

      <!-- <p class="text-xl leading-normal">We are passionate in doing what we can to offer our brides a truly
        sustainable choice. Our treasure trove dresses are already in existence
        and deserve the opportunity of being worn!  They are our most eco-
        friendly choice and are budget friendly too with most dresses costing on
        average £500-£1000. Our planet conscious brides love the fact that they
        are saving a dress from ending up in landfill as well as saving their
        pennies.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl leading-normal">Our commissioned for you collection is exactly that. We know that
        sample dresses are not everyone’s cup of tea, and that some of you
        prefer to purchase a new dress for many different reasons. We therefore
        made a conscious decision to stock two designers that hold similar
        values to ourselves. They aim to be as sustainable as possible – they do
        not mass produce and simply make dresses to order to a bride’s
        requirements. They enable us to be fully inclusive by being available to
        order in any size and with custom features.
